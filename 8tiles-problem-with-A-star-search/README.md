# 8-Tile Problem with A Search

This script solves the classic 8-tile puzzle using the A* search algorithm. A* combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and a heuristic approach, efficiently finding the shortest path to the goal state by evaluating potential moves based on cost and estimated distance to the target.
