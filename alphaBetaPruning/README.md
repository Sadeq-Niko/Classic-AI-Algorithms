#Simple Pencil Game with Minimax Tree and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This implementation of the Minimax algorithm showcases a two-player pencil game where players take turns to make optimal moves. Alpha-beta pruning is applied to optimize the decision-making process by reducing the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree, allowing for faster computation without sacrificing accuracy.
**note**: The implementation of algorithm is complete but the UI is yet to be usable.
