#N-Queens Problem with Simulated Annealing

In this script, the N-Queens problem is solved using **Simulated Annealing**, a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. By mimicking the cooling process of metals, the algorithm iteratively searches for a valid configuration of queens, balancing exploration and exploitation to escape local optima.
