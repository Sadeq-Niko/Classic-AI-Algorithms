# Fredkin Gate Simulation

This code simulates the behavior of the **Fredkin gate**, a reversible logic gate. The implementation allows for the exploration of its unique characteristics and applications in reversible computing, offering insights into how logical operations can be performed with minimal energy loss. This implementation's focus is to show that the **Fredkin gate** is not able solve **nonlinear** problems.
