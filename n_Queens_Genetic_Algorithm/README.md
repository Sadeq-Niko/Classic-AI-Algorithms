# N-Queens Problem with Genetic Algorithm

This implementation tackles the N-Queens problem using a **Genetic Algorithm**, demonstrating how evolutionary principles can be applied to optimize solutions. By simulating natural selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm searches for valid configurations of N queens on a chessboard that do not threaten each other.
